Introduction
------------------------------
The correct forecasting of sales at retail outlets is becoming more and more important to the performance of retail corporations. Achieving correct inventory levels can boost sales, improve customer satisfaction and reduce costs from excessive markdowns and supply chain issues. 

Walmart has provided historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions. This data is publicly available on kaggle.com. The goal is to project the sales for these stores in a given time frame. Several store features are given, including but not limited to: unemployment rate, fuel price and temperature. Information about markdowns and major holidays are also given. In this project, four methods will be used to explore this time series forecasting problem: Seasonal Naïve, Neural Network, and two versions of Linear Regression. The performance of each method will be assessed, and the best performing algorithm will be determined. The metric for success will be the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). 


Conclusion
----------------------------------

In this project, the forecasting of retail stores sales has been performed using various techniques. The goal was to predict the sales, by week, for 45 stores based on historical sales data as well as information about the stores, economic conditions and climate during the historical period. To become familiar with time series analysis, various works (see Sources) were studied before determining an approach. First, the data was cleaned and analyzed to note trends, seasonality and any missing data. Data mining techniques like Seasonal Naïve, Neural Network, and Linear Regression were implemented, and the results compared.  The Ex-Ante Linear Regression was observed to perform the best at prediction, having a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 4.12%, a median of 2.6% and a range of 26.43%. With the ever-increasing amount of data collected by retailers, understanding machine learning techniques for forecasting becomes ever more relevant in gaining and maintaining a competitive business edge.
